# Python Text-Based RPG

The main point of this game was to help me learn and mostly create a game that I think is fun to play and would WANT to play.

A text-based RPG written in Python that includes:

- Turn-based battles
- Randomly generated enemies
- Gold and leveling system
- Shops for buying weapons, armor, and potions
- Stat progression and upgrades

## Features Planned
- Quests with rewards (gold, XP, items)
- Boss fights every 5 enemies
- Inventory system
- Save/load system

## How to Run

1. Download the code from this repo
2. Run `main.py` in your favorite Python editor (like Thonny or Mu)
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play

## Why I Built This

I'm 15 and learning programming by building games Iâ€™d want to play. This game helped me practice functions, variables, and game logic in Python.

## Future Goals

I plan to add:
- A quest system (e.g., "Defeat 10 enemies")
- Rarity-based items in the shop
- More complex enemy scaling and storyline bosses


ðŸ§  Built entirely with functions and Python 3.11.
